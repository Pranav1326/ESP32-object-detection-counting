# Object Counting and Gate Control System using ESP32

This project demonstrates a simple object counting and gate control system using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system utilizes an IR obstacle avoidance sensor to detect objects, a servo motor to control the gate, and an LED to indicate the presence of an obstacle.
